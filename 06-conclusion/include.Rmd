# Conclusion

It is clear to us that Gotos is not a finished project, but it sets down a solid foundation for further development.
Future work should focus on using it for creating real world assignments so that the experience may be refined and enhanced.

Through this project we have learned a great deal about many different concepts that we hope to apply to further improve Gotos until it can be used by students.

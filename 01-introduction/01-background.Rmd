## Background and motivation

This section briefly covers the situation and motivation around which this thesis/report is based.

### Current situation

This thesis is written for and under guidance of The University of Stavanger (\acrshort{uis}).
The current situation at UiS is that operating systems concepts are introduced as part of the course _Operating Systems and Systems Programming - DAT320_.

"The course gives an introduction to operating systems, how to implement them, and how to program against them efficiently, with particular focus on thread programming and synchronization between threads within a program."

This course is taught using Go @gobook, and some C. @k&r

#### Prerequisites

To gain an idea of what prior knowledge can be expected of students, it is a good idea to look at the prerequisites for the course.
At the time of writing, this is a third semester course and the required and recommended prerequisites are as follows: @dat320-web

- ING100 Introductory course for engineers - Computer science and electrical engineering, and
- DAT110 Introduction to Programming,

which appear as first and second semester courses, utilising MATLAB and Python respectively.
While these languages are certainly useful, they don't require, nor give much intuition about computer architecture.

#### DAT320 learning outcomes @dat320-web

At the time of writing, these are the currently listed learning outcomes. @dat320-web

***Knowledge:***

- How an operating system works
- How to protect the operating system from malicious software

***Skills:***

- Be capable of programming against the operating system API
- Be capable of programming parts of an operating system
- Be capable of implementing simple mechanisms for resourse management
- Know how to program with threads
- Know how to exploit virtualization for resource management

***General competency***

- Know important general principles for resource management for computer systems.

#### Teaching methodology

The current course is taught through a series of lectures and lab-assignments, and parts of the book _Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces_. @ostep

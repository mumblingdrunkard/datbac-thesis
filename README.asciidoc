= Datbac thesis

This is my thesis, it uses RMarkdown and a very customized pandoc template.

== Compiling this project

You will need a LaTeX environment on your system. If you're on Linux, the
easiest way to accomplish this is to install `texlive-full` or whatever
variation is available for your system. On my system (Fedora 35), the package is
named `texlive-schema-full` and I install it by running
`sudo dnf install texlive-schema-full`.

You will likely also need `pandoc`. On my system, I run
`sudo dnf install pandoc`.

You will need to have `R` installed on your system as well as a few packages:

.In R
[source,R]
----
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("bookdown")
----

You should now be able to run `make` from the source directory. The resultant
pdf-file should be generated as `output/_main.pdf`. This does not include the
glossary however. If you want the glossaries, run `make pdf-final`. This
performs two passes over the document to include the glossary list.

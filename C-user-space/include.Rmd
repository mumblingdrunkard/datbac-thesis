# Writing user-space applications for the Gotos emulator {#ap:user-space}

We provide a short guide for writing and compiling applications for Gotos, either for testing, teaching, or any other purpose.

## Constraints

We are working with some constraints in Gotos:

- there is no standard library (yet),
- there is no HAL (yet),
- there are no libraries.

## Minimal working example

## Structuring the code

The implementation consists mainly of two packages: `cpu` and `system`.
Most of the provided code exists inside the `cpu` package.
Some system code is given in the `system` package and students should be able to do ***all*** assignments working inside this package.

### File/package structure

The `cpu` package contains the emulator itself and interfaces for communicating with it.

```{.txt #lst:filetree caption="File structure of Gotos" numbers=none frame=none float=!ht}
+-- go.mod
+-- main.go
+-- c-programs
|   +-- fib
|   +-- ...
|   +-- the-answer
+-- cpu
|   +-- cache.go
|   +-- ...
|   +-- zifencei.go
+-- system
    +-- boot_handler.go
    +-- ...
    +-- trap_handler.go
```

The `system` package is currently experimental and does not contain much outside the scope of testing and experimenting with the interfaces and interactions in the `cpu` package.

### cpu.Core

`Core` is the struct which contains all the registers, controllers, and other variables that are private to a core, shown in listing\ \@ref(lst:core)

```{.go #lst:core caption="The Core struct." float=!ht}
// in cpu/core.go
type Core struct {
    bcm sync.Mutex

    system System

    state   coreState
    jumped  bool
    counter counter

    reg  [32]uint32
    freg [32]uint64
    pc   uint32

    interruptCounter uint32
    interruptedBy    uint32
    interruptCode    uint32

    mc memoryController

    csr [4096]uint32
}
```

The first field, `bcm`, is the *big core mutex* which ensures that only one goroutine can be active per core.
The other fields are explained through the rest of this chapter.

### cpu.System interface

It is necessary to provide some isolation between the `cpu` and `system` packages, and is achieved by `cpu` providing the `System` interface as shown in listing\ \@ref(lst:04-system-interface).

(ref:cap-04-system-interface) The `System` interface in Gotos consists of handlers and functions that should return pointers to shared resources.

```{.go #lst:04-system-interface caption="(ref:cap-04-system-interface)" float=!ht}
// in cpu/interfaces.go
type System interface {
    // handlers
    HandleTrap(*Core)
    HandleBoot(*Core)
    // shared resources
    Memory() *Memory
    ReservationSets() *ReservationSets
    InterruptMatrix() *InterruptMatrix
    WgAwake() *sync.WaitGroup
    WgRunning() *sync.WaitGroup
}
```

```{r 04-core, fig.cap='Simple overview of the Core in Gotos, showing the main components.'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath('fig/core-overview.pdf'))
```

The rest of the chapter describes the minimal few system interfaces that should be or are implemented.
When creating a new `Core` using `cpu.NewCore()`, we should pass a pointer to a struct that implements the `System` interface.
In this way, `System` acts as a bridge between the `cpu` package and a system we might implement; it serves as a logical cutoff.
When a core needs to perform a trap, it should call `HandleTrap()`, passing a pointer to itself as shown in\ \@ref(lst:03-trap).
The `HandleTrap()` function should, in return, use information from the core to properly handle the event.
This enables a core to access system functionality as a sort of co-processor instead of directly executing the individual RISC-V instructions as it would in a real system.

## Accessing CPU resources from a system

As system code is expected to exist in a different package, Gotos exposes multiple functions to access internal resources of a `Core`.
These functions are written in a way to minimise incorrect usage and usually take the form of getters and setters with named resources.

We achieve a safe interface for most resources by only exposing functions that are safe.

### Registers

Take, for example, the function `Core.GetIRegister()` which takes an argument of type `Reg` and returns a `uint32`.
This function accepts type `Reg` whose values are enumerated in the file `cpu/register.go`.
As the `Core` has thirty-two integer registers, we minimise incorrect usage by allowing only correct values to be used for accessing these internal registers.
Additionally, we encourage to use the semantic names defined in the RISC-V specification (See table 25.1, column "ABI Name" in the specification\ [@rv5vol1]), though the "raw" names are also exposed as `Reg_XNN` where `NN` is a number 0 -- 31.

The semantic names follow a similar pattern, but also convey usage: e.g. `Reg_A0` -- an alias for `Reg_X10` -- is the first *argument register*, used for passing normal, non-floating-point function arguments.
See file `cpu/register.go` for all names.

This pattern of registers being accessible to external consumers only through named constants, applies to all internal registers: base registers through `GetIRegister()`, floating-point registers through `GetFRegister()`, and control status registers through `GetCSR()`.

### Physical memory

Although physical memory is already accessible to the system (because it implements the `System` interface from which the memory comes), it is semantically "unaesthetic" to access resources in a direct manner such as `s.memory.WriteRaw(...)`.

The code that runs through a trap-handler (which applies to most of the code students will be writing), runs *as if* it is executing on the core.
It logically follows that we should access system resources from the perspective of the core.
We provide two functions to access physical memory from the perspective of the core: `AtomicStoreWordPhysicalUncached()` and `AtomicLoadWordPhysicalUncached()`.

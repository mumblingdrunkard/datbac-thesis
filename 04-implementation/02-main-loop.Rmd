## Executing instructions

Most processors have an fetch-execute cycle, a general flow that instructions follow through the processor; our emulator is no different.
Cores can be in three general states: *running*, *halted*, and *stopped*.

### Core startup

### Checking counters and interrupts

### Instruction fetch decode and execute

### Traps

### Halting

### Stopping

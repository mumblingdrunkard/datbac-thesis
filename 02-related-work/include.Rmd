## Nachos

Nachos is an instructional OS

## Xv6 {#sec:02-xv6}

Xv6 is a popular teaching OS, developed at MIT

## Nielsen et al. 2019 -- Biscuit

An earlier bachelor's project from 2019 looked into using Biscuit -- a research OS written with Go and assembly -- as a base to teach OS concepts.
The goal was to be able to use Go to write OS components through a series of lab-assignments.
Go, having garbage collection and a strong standard library, is easier for new students than a language like C or C++ as used in Xv6 or Nachos.

Biscuit is not written to be an intstructional operating system, and from all the challenges faced, it was found to be unsuitable for use in the class.

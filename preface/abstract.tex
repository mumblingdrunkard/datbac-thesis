The \Gls{latex} typesetting markup language is specially suitable for documents that include mathematics.
The \acrlong{cpu} (\acrshort{cpu}) is the ''brain'' of the computer.
It loads and executes instructions from \acrlong{ram} (\acrshort{ram}), operating on data from \acrshort{ram} or from external devices.
These devices can be memory-mapped, called \acrlong{mmio} (\acrshort{mmio}) which lets the \acrshort{cpu} operate purely on memory, not caring about whether it is \acrshort{ram} or some memory-mapped device.

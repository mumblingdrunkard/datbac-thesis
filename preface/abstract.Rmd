# ABSTRACT {-}

The current assignments for the class *"Operating Systems and Systems Programming DAT320"* @dat320-web at \acrshort{uis} are disconnected and lack a unifying framework.
OS components are simulated, and students write some code to interface with these.
However, the lack of a framework means that interactions between these components are difficult or impossible to explore, ignoring a vital part of OS development.

This project delivers a framework that provides the necessary complexity that operating systems naturally deal with, but without excluding the intended audience: third-semester students at UiS.
A RISC-V emulator is included to provide the required complexity of managing actual processes with resources.
However, the emulator only executes in user/application mode, delegating traps to the surrounding system written in a high-level, garbage-collected programming language, executing on real hardware.

Implementing OS components in a high-level language simplifies kernel resource management, allowing students to focus on more fundamental concepts of processor virtualisation, limited direct execution, memory virtualisation, and protection.
The emulator ensures that students can fully observe the effect of the components they build by seeing how changes affect performance and other metrics.

The new assignments have largely the same focus as the old ones but emphasise guidance instead of exploration.
By guiding students through assignments, we hope to cover more material than can be expected when students have to explore.

This project has resulted in several components such as a RISC-V user-mode emulator, a loose -- but functional -- system interface, a series of assignments, and a book that guides the assignments.

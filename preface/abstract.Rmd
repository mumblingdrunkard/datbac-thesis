# ABSTRACT {-}

The current assignments for the class *"Operating Systems and Systems Programming DAT320"* @dat320-web at \acrshort{uis} are disconnected and lack a unifying framework.
OS components are simulated, and students write some code to interface with these.
However, the lack of a framework means that interactions between these components are difficult or impossible to explore, skipping a vital part of OS development.

This project delivers a framework that provides the necessary complexity that operating systems naturally deal with, but without excluding the intended audience: third-semester students at UiS.
A multicore RISC-V emulator is included to provide the required complexity of managing actual processes with resources.
However, the emulator only executes in user/application mode, delegating traps to the surrounding system written in a high-level, garbage-collected programming language, executing on real hardware.

Implementing OS components in a high-level language simplifies kernel resource management, allowing students to focus on more fundamental concepts of processor virtualisation, limited direct execution, memory virtualisation, and protection.
The emulator enables students to explore how their implementations affect, and are affected by real workloads.

Using a user-mode emulator aside a high-level language to teach operating systems is not a novel concept.
Nachos implemented this exact idea and served as proof that this is a viable approach. @nachos-report
However, since its inception in 1992, advancements have been made and operating systems now have to deal with multiple cores in a single system.

We believe that we are presenting proof that a multicore emulated architecture is also possible; one that can provide the added complexity of writing a multicore operating system while staying simple enough that undergraduate students can realistically understand the fundamentals within a semester.

# Architecture

To achieve the goal of a unifying framework, we decided to create a processor emulator that executes instructions in user-mode, but leaves the tasks of the operating system to be implemented in a higher-level language.
This description largely matches that of Nachos which implements a MIPS emulator and leaves OS components to be implemented in C++ or Java\ @nachos-report.

In this chapter we present the processor emulator included with Gotos and associated architectural decisions.
It is a plain emulator, primarily inspired by the RISC-V specification.

## This is a test section

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

### Code blocks

See listing \@ref(code:example-1) for an example of a code block.

```{label="code:example-1" caption="This is a caption" .go}
func add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

We can also style the code blocks with the help of pandoc when the `--listings` option is passed to pandoc (as is the case here if we look in `_output.yml`).
See listing \@ref(code:example-2) for a code block that has been styled with no frame and with line numbering on the left, starting at line 76.

```{numbers=left firstnumber=76 frame=none label="code:example-2" caption="Code block with numbered lines and no frame" .go}
func add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

### Figures

See figure \@ref(fig:example-1) for an example of a generated figure.
This figure was generated using R.
This is very useful.
For example, you can import data from a csv-file, generate a figure from it, and output it into your document.
If the data changes, so does the figure.
No need to generate and re-export any figures.

```{r example-1, echo=F, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Example figure"}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(1:10, col=2)
plot(density(runif(100, 0.0, 1.0)))
plot(runif(100, 0.0, 1.0),type="l")
```

### Tables

The same is true for tables as is for figures.
It is very useful to have code to generate tables.
In this vein, it is possible to import data from a csv-file and output a table of the data into the document.
Very handy!

### Footnotes

Note^[It is possible to add footnotes to a document. Handy for adding further clarifications that don't really fit into the flow of the text.]

### Lists

- You can write lists with very simple syntax
- This is great because it avoids the cluttered \LaTeX syntax for lists

1. You can also create ordered lists
1. Very cool^[Notice that in the source code for this file, I've used `1.` for both list-entries, but these were automatically ordered properly.]

i. These can use many different symbols and formats

a. Though it's probably best to stick with one.

1. You
   (a) Can
       i. Even
       i. Nest
       i. Them
   (a) Very cool!

### Theorems and proofs

Bookdown supplies very nice facilities for theorems^[Other environments that behave in a similar manner include lemma, corollary, proposition, conjecture, definition, example, exercise, and hypothesis.]:

:::{.theorem}
The pythagorean theorem.

The theorem goes as follows
$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$
holds true for any right-angled triangle where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the two legs and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.
:::

It is also possible to write proofs, which are similar, but not numbered.

:::{.proof}
This is a proof.

The end of a proof is marked with a square.
:::


Variants of the proof environments include remark and solution.

:::{.exercise}
Prove the pythagorean theorem.
